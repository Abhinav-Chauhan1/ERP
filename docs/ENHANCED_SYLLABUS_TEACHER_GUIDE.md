## Tracking Progress

### Marking Sub-Modules as Completed

To track your teaching progress:

1. Expand a module to view its sub-modules
2. Click the checkbox next to a sub-module when you've covered that topic
3. The system will:
   - Mark the sub-module as completed
   - Record the completion timestamp
   - Update the module's completion percentage
   - Update the overall syllabus completion percentage

### Unmarking Completed Sub-Modules

If you need to unmark a sub-module:

1. Click the checked checkbox next to the sub-module
2. The system will:
   - Mark the sub-module as incomplete
   - Update the module's completion percentage
   - Update the overall syllabus completion percentage

### Automatic Module Completion

Modules are automatically marked as completed when:
- All sub-modules within the module are marked as completed
- The completion percentage reaches 100%

**Note**: You don't need to manually mark modules as completed.

## Understanding Progress Indicators

### Sub-Module Completion

- **Empty checkbox**: Sub-module not yet completed
- **Checked checkbox**: Sub-module completed
- **Timestamp**: Shows when the sub-module was marked as completed

### Module Progress Bar

Each module displays a progress bar showing:
- **Percentage**: Completion percentage (e.g., "60% Complete")
- **Visual bar**: Filled portion indicates progress
- **Color coding**:
  - Gray: Not started (0%)
  - Blue: In progress (1-99%)
  - Green: Completed (100%)

### Syllabus Progress

At the top of the syllabus, you'll see:
- **Overall completion percentage**: Average of all module percentages
- **Completed modules**: Number of modules at 100%
- **Total modules**: Total number of modules in the syllabus

### Progress Calculation

**Module completion percentage**:
```
(Completed Sub-Modules / Total Sub-Modules) × 100
```

**Syllabus completion percentage**:
```
(Sum of all Module Percentages) / Number of Modules
```

**Example**:
- Module 1: 3 of 4 sub-modules completed = 75%
- Module 2: 2 of 2 sub-modules completed = 100%
- Module 3: 0 of 3 sub-modules completed = 0%
- Syllabus: (75 + 100 + 0) / 3 = 58.33%

## Best Practices

### Tracking Progress Effectively

1. **Mark topics as you teach them**: Update progress in real-time or at the end of each class

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I edit the syllabus content?

No, only admin users can create, edit, or delete modules, sub-modules, and documents. Teachers have read-only access to content but can track their own progress.

### Can students see my progress?

No, your progress tracking is private. Students see completion indicators (which topics have been covered) but not your personal tracking data.

### What happens if I accidentally mark something as completed?

Simply click the checkbox again to unmark it. The system will update the progress percentages accordingly.

### Can I download all documents at once?

Currently, documents must be downloaded individually. Use the bulk download feature (if available) or download documents as needed.

### How often is the syllabus updated?

Admins can update the syllabus at any time. Refresh the page to see the latest changes.

### Can I access the syllabus offline?

The syllabus requires an internet connection to view. However, you can download documents for offline access.

### What if a document won't open?

Ensure you have the appropriate software installed (PDF reader, Word, PowerPoint, etc.). If issues persist, contact your admin.

### Can I print the syllabus?

Use your browser's print function to print the syllabus. Expand all modules before printing for a complete view.
